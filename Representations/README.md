# Landscape of Representation Theory

Here's an incomplete list of different flavours of "symmetries" that  we can consider their representations. Representations also have different flavours: over  complex, real, p-adic, finite fields, or any number system that you can think of. We can also organize atomic representations
into more complicated, structured and compound representations. 

## Finite groups
    * Finite abelian groups
    * Symmetric groups
    * Reflection groups and Coxeter groups, Dihedral groups
    * Weyl groups 
    * **Finite simple group of Lie type**
        - PSL_2(7), non-isomorphic but isospectral graphs
        - Drinfeld curve, Deligne-Lusztig varieties 

## Profinite groups

## Automorphic groups

## Compact simple groups
    * Connected simple groups
    * Finite simple groups

## Locally compact groups
    * Locally compact abelian groups
        - Pontryagin duality
    * Noncompact simple groups
        - Connected
        - Countable discrete
        - Nondiscrete totally disconnected
    * p-adic Lie groups
        - Tamagawa numbers, Bruhat-Tits trees.

## Lie groups

    * Compact Lie groups [Reference](https://github.com/Waerden001/Harmonic_Analysis_Database/blob/master/Representations/Representations%20of%20classical%20compact%20Lie%20groups.pdf)
    * Real Lie groups
    * Complex Lie groups
        - Reductive complex groups
        - Semisimple complex groups
        - Infinite dimensional groups
            - Mapping class groups
            - Diffeomorphism groups
    
    
## Algebraic groups

    * Finite fields
    * Global fields
        - number fields
        - Function fields

        - Infinite dimensional complex Lie algebras
            - Heisenberg
            - Virasoro
            - Affine, Kac-Moody
            - Current algebras
